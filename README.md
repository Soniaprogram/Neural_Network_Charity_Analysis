# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

The report should contain the following:

## Overview of the analysis:
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
Using your knowledge of Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler(), you’ll need to preprocess the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model later in Deliverable 2.

### Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
### Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model

## Results:
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

## Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
