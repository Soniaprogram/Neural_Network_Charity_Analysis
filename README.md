# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

The report should contain the following:

## Overview of the analysis:
For the non-profit organization Alphabet Soup, I designed a deep learning neural network that will predict if an Alphabet Soup funded organization will be successful based on features provided in the given dataset.

### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
Using my knowledge of Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler(), I preprocessed the given dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model that will be developed in Deliverable 2.

### Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Using my knowledge of TensorFlow, I designed a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. I was required to think about how many inputs there were before determining the number of neurons and layers in my model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

### Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize your model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. If you can't achieve an accuracy higher than 75%, you'll need to make at least three attempts to do so.

## Results:
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

## Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
